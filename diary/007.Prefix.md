# prefix

I was coding a few days ago, and I should have used a prefix. The biggest problem, too, is naming.  
I found it in the dictionary.

[Oxford Dictionary's 'prefix'](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/prefix_1?q=prefix "Oxford Learner's Dictionaries link")

## prefix

noun
/priːfɪks/

1. ​(grammar) a letter or group of letters added to the beginning of a word to change its meaning, such as 'un-' in unhappy and 'pre'- in preheat
1. ​a word, letter, or number that is put before another
1. ​(old-fashioned) a title such as Dr or Mrs used before a person’s name

**Use Case**
  
1
- negative prefixes such as ‘un-’ and ‘dis-’

2  
- Car insurance policies have the prefix MC (for motor cars).


### Prefix Characteristics

- It gives meaning.
- It has more meaning than a suffix.
- It originated in Latin and Greek.

For some reason, knowing a lot of prefixes will make studying English much easier.

It was fun as soon as I checked the meaning of a word. However, I feel at a loss when I think I should study and memorize this.  

I found a funny video.
