# A Spy

Let's write the Alphabet uppercase or lowercase in the blank.  

- A - a
- ( ) - b
- C - c
- ( ) - d
- E - e
- F - ( )
- G - g
- ( ) - h

The correct is '(B), (D), (f), (H)'.  
Is it alright?  
Uppercase 'C' and lowercase 'c' are the same shapes. Only the size is a difference.  
Do you have letters that have the same shape but different sizes like 'c' and 'C'?  

> ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ  
> abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

"C, O, P, S, U, V, W, X, Z" all have the same shape but have different sizes and positions.

Anywhere is a spy.

Who do you think is the epitome of a spy?  
I saw *'007 James bond'*. However, *'007 Jame bond'* is a movie. Who is more famous for their true story than a movie.

Who is the most famous real-life spy beside the movie?

Do you know *'Richard Sorge'?*    
He is a German. By the way, He was a soviet spy and had japan at his disposal.  

He is a German. But, Why does he was a Soviet spy? Was it because of the money? I don't know the details.  

I think the scariest thing is faith. 

Perhaps because of the spy stories, I don't get bored looking at the Wikipedia dictionary.   
If you have time spare, Search ''Richard Sorge'' in the Wikipedia Dictionary.

That's it for today. Goodnights. I'm so tired.  
See you tomorrow.  
Bye! Bye!
