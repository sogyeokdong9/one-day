In the picture, There are many things.  

First, there is a big Tree. A boy and a girl sit on the brunch.  
The boy is watching the girls. The girl is sitting on a brunch and picking apples.  
There were squirrels around the boy. Of course, the boy also was sitting on the brunch. They seem to be happy.

The giraffe was eating leaves. The elephant was watering the tree.  
It was like a scene on a pleasant afternoon.

A bus. These are four people.
