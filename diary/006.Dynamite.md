# Dynamite

Relay from yesterday to today. Today's song is also Dynamite.  
I didn't know this song was this long.  
How far did I study this song yesterday? Give a second. I will be back after checking how far I've written.  

I studied up to here yesterday.  

*Ladies and gentlemen, I got the medicine.*
*So you should keep ya eyes on the ball, huh.*

Well, let's keep studying the rest.

Length is long. However, the Most context was a study yesterday.    
Cause I think that today very easy. Contrary to expectations, it ended very early today. I am super happy.    

I'm getting heavy.    
Can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready(woohoo).    
 
I'll leave a link to this song.
